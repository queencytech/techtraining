Git was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, It is a Version Control System (VCS) used for merging files, make changes and create local repository of a program on your computer and it can be synced with a remote server such as github. It is a tool that allows developers to have access to codes and it makes it much more efective for being able to have different teams work on different programs. It tracks history, supports non-linear development and makes branching easier.
